# Open-Source-Wearables

This project is meant to act as an open library of wearable components, techniques, or research related to wearing technology. This is a personal repository that I am using to organize my thoughts, but I want for my work to be used and built upon. Choose MIT or Apache2 for licensing and just attribute Pipeargill if you find anything useful in your project.

### Project Overview  

The first goal of this project is to develop a modular wearable system starting with the 3M 6000 Series Respirator Masks.  

![20241205_011155](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/896af129-97d1-4a42-aae2-ec2b246f2b39)  

This project revolves around adapting the 3M 6000 series respirator mask into a versatile platform for building cosplay helmets and fursuit heads. I’ve discovered that wearing a respirator mask, especially for seasonal allergies, is not only more comfortable than taking allergy medications but gives me an awesome opportunity to design custom wearables that attach securely to a mask.

The respirator masks are affordable, fairly comfortable, feature an anti-fog exhaust port, and have adjustable straps—making them ideal for attaching various 3D-printed designs. The aim of this project is to create modular adapters and accessories that allow the creation of custom cosplay, fursuit, cyberwear, or prosthesis designs that can be easily attached to the mask.

## Cyberwear  
This category is for functional parts that add to a wearable's functionality or act as some sort of usability aid or prosthesis. Think anything from lights and sounds to standing support, digilegs, or wearable information and computer systems.

## Cosplay  
This category is for parts and techniques related to turning 3D designs into wearables. Think hard shell armor and character faces printed directly.

## Fursuit  
This category is for parts and techniques related to turning character concepts into wearables that utilize a fabric, textile, or faux-fur outer layer.

## Utility/Tactical
This category is for anything that has a specific functon other than looking cool.

## Solutions
This category is a catch-all for components that adapt one thing to another, hold a thing in a place, or otherwise solve a problem or adapt one category into another.

## Toolbox  
This category is for relief cuts or other tools.

### Current Development  

I am currently working on 3D modeling adapters that allow the respirator mask to be attached. I have one adapter almost ready for beta and a few more in development. The long-term goal is to make the system modular to allow users to easily swap parts based on their design needs or to easily relief cut their own 3D design into a compatible part for this system.  

#### Remote Air Supply  

Adapter set almost ready for beta!
v0.3 12/24/24

These adapters seem expensive for no good reason. I will soon design adapters for CPAP hoses and other common air supply methods.

![449N09_AS01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/131754bf-49d7-4a22-9b09-74cc93862436)  

This is a low-profile adapter to allow air supply connections that can fit under a mask. I am considering it a Cyberwear part simply because it is used in a functional rather than aesthetic way, but it will be a base component for many other designs that will fall into other categories.  

#### S-1 Beta 0.1 Pre-release  

![20241220_141349](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96c4d9f9-0415-4d9d-a78a-f0f5af11f968)  

I am currently working on the corresponding part that will connect to the filter and allow for remote placement.

## Research into molecular geomety

After seeing Crash Makerspace's video on using resin 3D printed structures, I started really thinking about this problem in my idle time and after reading a comment by @erokfussell in the video I decided to research diamond covalent bond structures. I really appreciated this video for explaining the concepts in a way that was approachable to the way I understand materials and force. 

I looked around a bit and found a model that was interesting because it was a lattus structure nested within another lattus structure.

### Future Accessories and Electronics  

In addition to the modular base adapters, I envision adding accessories such as:  

- **Documentation on 18v power supply**: I utilize Ridgid 18v drill packs because they have a low voltage cutoff that is useful. I don't recommend DeWalt 20v batteries without a controller board because they can be ran down to 0v.
I'm using adapter plates that I bought, but I can design out some printed ones that use male spade connections to interface with the batteries. I've found a 12/24v USB/C marine adapter that works great with 16-22v or whatever drillpacks are. There's also a neat 3A buck/boost converter that I've found that could also be useful.

- **Motorcycle/MTB Helmet Integration**: A version that works with a full-face helmet on top of a half mask.
  
- **Transhumanist Stillsuit**: With a focus on adapting to air quality concerns, this suit aims to normalize mask-wearing in everyday life with potential for oxygen or inhaler supply.  
- **Mobility Support**: Features focused on user needs such as standing, walking, or wheelchair/mobility aid adapters.  
- **Electronic Integrations**: Future designs will incorporate electronics like heads-up displays, lights, external displays, speakers, fans, ect.
- **Meshtastic/Radio**: Embedding comms systems.  
- **Wide View Periscopes**: For TV head/Foreverwinter digital shaman design. May end up doing a video feed, but I want to experiment with mirrors a bit here.
  
- **Dissect a used camera with a digital viewfinder for digital periscope**: Find common enough model
  
- **Space Marine/Zaku/Jin Roh Suit**: Focus on larger/bulky armored cosplay base.  
- **Tactical/Utilitarian Suit**: A base focused on practical use over form.  
- **Ballistics**: Use of embedded printed structures that help resist bullet impacts—explore molecular geometries such as diamond, double diamond, graphene, and variations on these structures.

- **TV Head Prince Robot IV**: TV head character that I plan to cosplay, which should make a good base design.  
- **Puppet Head on Long Neck**: I want to try this as a way to add more articulation to a head that is puppeted on top of the user's head.

#### Proof of Concept - Test Print 1 (12/1/24)  

![20241201_193228](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fa09887-2368-43ce-a3f5-a60393812566)  

**First Prototype Notes**  
The first prototype was a simple test design to see how the 3D print would attach to the exhaust port of the respirator mask.  

- **Prototype**: Horse skull adapter for 3M 6200 half-mask respirator.  
- **Objective**: Test fit, angle adjustment, and clearance.  
- **Result**: Mostly a failure, but it was able to be mounted and allowed me to measure how far I was off.
